## 5.0.1+1.4.0

- Role requires Ansible version >= 2.7 now

## 5.0.0+1.4.0

- Update `cfssl` tools to version 1.4.0
- Since Cloudflare changed the way how to distribute binaries it's no longer possible to use `cfssl` binaries before version 1.4.0. If you need older binaries you can clone this Github repository and checkout `v4.0.0+1.2.0` branch
- Added new binaries: `cfssl-bundle`,`cfssl-certinfo`,`cfssl-newkey`,`cfssl-scan`, `mkbundle` and `multirootca`
- `cfssl_version` changed to `1.4.0`

- `cfssl_checksum_url` specifies the URL to a file that contains the SHA256 checksums for the various `cfssl` binaries
- `cfssl_arch` variable only supports `amd64` at the moment. Other architectures no longer supported

## Tags removed - no functionality change

- Removed all tags before `3.0.0+1.2.0`. That was needed because Ansible Galaxy don't work with version tags that don't respect semantic versioning scheme (SemVer)

## 4.0.0+1.2.0

- allow other architectures to download
- checksum as variable and for `cfssl` and `cfssljson` binary
- add Archlinux as supported platform

## 3.0.0+1.2.0

- use correct semantic versioning as described in [semver](https://semver.org). Needed for Ansible Galaxy importer as it now insists on using semantic versioning.
- moved changelog entries to separate file
- make Ansible linter happy
- no major changes but decided to start a new major release as versioning scheme changed quite heavily

## v2.0.0_r1.2.0

- removed `cfssl_conf_directory` variable (not needed as this role only installs the CFSSL binaries)

## v1.0.0_r1.2.0

- initial release

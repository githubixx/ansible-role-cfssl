ansible-role-cfssl
==================

Installes CFSSL (CloudFlare's PKI toolkit) binaries. I used it as a lightweight certificate authority (CA) for Kubernetes. This Ansible playbook is used in [Kubernetes the not so hard way with Ansible - certificate authority](https://www.tauceti.blog/post/kubernetes-the-not-so-hard-way-with-ansible-certificate-authority/).

Versions
--------

I tag every release and try to stay with [semantic versioning](http://semver.org). If you want to use the role I recommend to checkout the latest tag. The master branch is basically development while the tags mark stable releases. But in general I try to keep master in good shape too.

The tag `5.0.0+1.4.0` means that this is the release `5.0.0` of the Ansible role which uses release `1.4.0` of CFSSL.

Changelog
